# Receipter - Walrus-Native Agent Memory Market

Receipter is a Walrus-native operator console for hiring worker agents safely. It exists to make agent work durable and reusable: every task becomes a paid work order, every delivery must produce source-backed evidence, every completed run becomes a portable Walrus memory record, and Sui owns the agent passport, payment/finality rail, receipt anchor, and stake/slash accountability layer.

The core product is the Walrus memory layer plus a Sui-native agent identity object. Walrus stores the full evidence and memory; Sui owns the `AgentPassport`, gates access with SUI-denominated x402-style paid HTTP access, anchors compact proof hashes, and attaches slashable stake to the passport.

## Core Product Loop

1. Buyer writes task, private notes, acceptance criteria, checker pack, and max SUI payment.
2. Receipter strips private notes and secret-looking lines.
3. Receipter creates a worker-facing safe packet.
4. Receipter scores the worker route against prior Walrus memory before execution.
5. Receipter creates a verification manifest, memory scope, and Sui work order id.
6. Worker task access is guarded by an x402-style HTTP 402 challenge.
7. The challenge carries a Sui Payment Kit-compatible URI plus Payment Intent metadata for that exact work order.
8. Hirer agent retries with a Sui payment payload.
9. The local Sui facilitator/verifier for the x402-style flow verifies run, resource, nonce, amount, receiver, worker, and Sui settlement.
10. Worker agent receives the paid task packet and delivers source-backed evidence.
11. The verification layer checks claim-to-source binding, evidence strength, Walrus readiness, and settlement blockers.
12. Full receipt/evidence is stored as a Walrus memory bundle only after delivery.
13. The Walrus bundle becomes the worker's portable agent memory record.
14. Compact proof fields are committed to the Sui receipt registry only when verification is admissible.
15. The worker reputation passport updates only after the Sui receipt anchor is recorded.
16. The Sui `AgentPassport` object points at the latest Walrus blob, latest memory hash, latest Sui anchor digest, and stake position.
17. Future work orders use the worker's Walrus memory passport in the pre-run trust gate.

## Walrus Memory Layer

Walrus is the durable memory substrate, not a side upload. Every delivered run produces a `receipter.agent_memory_record.v1` with task summary, claim counts, average claim support, evidence strength, settlement action, Walrus blob id, Sui anchor digest, and a stable memory hash. Records roll up into a `receipter.agent_memory_passport.v1` per worker and into a global `receipter.memory_index.v1`.

The backend writes memory through an injectable `MemoryStore` interface. The default `WalrusMemoryStore` wraps the raw Walrus HTTP publisher/aggregator path used in live testnet runs, while keeping the server ready for a future `MemWalMemoryStore` without changing the product API.

Passports are now Sui-native at the contract layer: `receipter::agent_passport::AgentPassport` is an owner-held Sui object with agent id, Walrus metadata pointer, latest memory hash, latest Walrus blob id, latest Sui anchor digest, record counts, challenge/slash counters, and a stake position reference. The API passport still exposes `ownerAddress` and `ownership` for app-level verification.

The memory layer gives the app its loop:

- workers remember across jobs through portable Walrus records
- buyers can inspect the exact memory that influenced routing
- future trust decisions include prior Walrus-backed performance
- weak prior claim support lowers the trust score before dispatch
- Sui anchors are compact finality signals for the larger Walrus memory bundle

The configured Walrus Testnet endpoints are the Mysten Labs reference publisher and aggregator from the Walrus Network Reference. Mainnet does not provide a public unauthenticated publisher, so production uploads need a private authenticated publisher, upload relay, or SDK integration.

Export a call plan:

```bash
npm run sui:anchor-plan <run-id>
```

In live `sui` mode, clients request signer-ready transaction data from `GET /api/runs/:id/payment-transaction` and `GET /api/runs/:id/anchor-transaction`. Payment settlement is accepted through `/api/x402/verify`; receipt anchoring is accepted through `POST /api/runs/:id/anchor-receipt` with the structured `anchorPayload` returned by the wallet flow. Raw `suiPaymentDigest` and `suiAnchorDigest` bypasses are rejected in live mode. `SUI_CLI_PATH` remains an explicit test-only fallback.

Do not claim mainnet anchoring until the package and Walrus publisher path are redeployed on mainnet.

In `sui` mode payment approval requires a verified signed x402-style Sui payment payload, the Walrus evidence step uses the configured HTTP publisher, and the Sui anchor step verifies the signed receipt-registry transaction through Sui JSON-RPC events before recording the digest. `sui-dev` remains a local smoke mode only; do not use it for the hackathon demo pitch.

Receipter generates Payment Kit-compatible URI metadata for SUI payment approval planning. Worker task access is exposed as x402-style paid HTTP access for agents on Sui: unpaid worker requests receive HTTP `402` with Sui payment instructions, and paid requests receive the task packet with an `X-Payment-Response` header bound to the recorded Sui transaction digest.

The app includes its own local Sui facilitator/verifier for this x402-style flow. In `sui` mode it calls `SUI_RPC_URL` with `sui_getTransactionBlock` and verifies successful execution, receiver balance change, a package-owned `PaymentIntentRecorded` event, Payment Kit nonce binding, request/resource binding, amount, receiver, coin type, worker id, and replay protection before unlocking the worker task. This is not a Coinbase-hosted facilitator and not an official Sui x402 network standard.

## Verification Layer

Receipter treats payment, delivery, memory admission, clearing, and reputation as separate gates. Delivery text alone is not settlement-grade memory. Each receipt gets a verification summary with:

- `admissibility`: `pending`, `insufficient`, or `admissible`
- `evidenceStrength`: `none`, `delivery_only`, `source_receipt`, `walrus_backed`, or `sui_anchored`
- `blockerIds`: unresolved checks that prevent clearing
- `settlementEligible`: true only when non-reputation blockers are cleared
- `reputationEligible`: true only after Sui anchoring

For research work, source-backed claims must be bound to observations in the worker source receipt. Each claim receives a support verdict: `supported`, `weak`, `stale`, `unbound`, or `contradicted`. The checker compares claim URL, title, statement, source record, record hash, and freshness. If claims are missing, stale, weak, malformed, or not bound to observations, clearing moves to `requires_review`, settlement action becomes `manual_review`, and Sui anchoring is blocked even if a Walrus blob exists.

## Competitive Positioning

Agent memory is an active category. The leading products prove the need, but most focus on app-local context retrieval rather than verifiable, portable work memory.

| Product | What they have | What they do not have that Receipter adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mem0 | Drop-in persistent memory for agents and apps, SDK integrations, memory compression, governance, audit logs, and enterprise controls. | No Walrus-backed portable memory bundle, no Sui payment-gated work order, no source-claim admission gate, no on-chain finality for compact memory proofs. |
| Zep / Graphiti | Enterprise agent memory with temporal context graphs, business/user/work memory, and benchmarked graph retrieval. | No decentralized blob memory layer, no paid agent-work marketplace, no Sui receipt registry anchor, no settlement blocker model before memory admission. |
| Letta | Stateful agents with memory blocks, shared memory, archival memory, long-running executions, and multi-agent patterns. | No Walrus-native storage target by default, no worker reputation passport derived from stored evidence, no x402-style Sui payment unlock, no proof object tying memory to payment and source evidence. |
| LangGraph memory | Short-term thread checkpoints and long-term memory stores for semantic/profile/episodic/procedural memory. | Framework primitives rather than a product loop; no durable Walrus memory ledger, no payment-bound agent marketplace, no automatic source-claim clearing, no Sui finality rail. |
| Plain RAG/vector DBs | Fast retrieval, embeddings, and app-specific context search. | Retrieval is not memory governance: no source-backed admission, no worker performance passport, no portable blob proof, no payment/finality coupling. |

Receipter does not try to beat these products at generic personalization memory. It focuses on a narrower wedge: **verifiable agent work memory**. A worker does a paid job, the system checks the evidence, Walrus stores the full memory artifact, Sui anchors the compact proof, and the next buyer can route work using that prior memory.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4174
```

For the live judging/demo path, use `RECEIPTER_MODE=sui` with the Sui and Walrus testnet env vars above, then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4174?live=1
```

With `?live=1`, `?judging=1`, or `?mode=judging`, the downloaded UI fails loudly if `/api/walrus/memory` is unavailable instead of falling back to bundled sample records. Without those flags, bundled records are allowed only as clearly labeled sample data for UI review.

## Commands

```bash
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run proof:latest
npm run sui:anchor-plan
npm run sui:x402-pay -- <run-id>
npm run smoke:x402-live
npm run smoke:full-live
```

## Agent API

The browser uses the same API external agents can call:

```text
POST /api/runs                         hirer agent creates a safe Sui work order
GET  /api/runs/:id/payment-transaction hirer gets signer-ready Sui payment transaction data
POST /api/x402/verify                  local Sui facilitator/verifier checks payment and unlocks work

GET  /api/runs/:id/worker-task         worker agent gets 402 until Sui payment is recorded
POST /api/runs/:id/worker-delivery     worker agent submits delivery evidence
POST /api/runs/:id/store-evidence      operator stores the memory bundle on Walrus
GET  /api/runs/:id/anchor-transaction  operator gets signer-ready Sui anchor transaction data
POST /api/runs/:id/anchor-receipt      operator submits verified anchorPayload from signed Sui tx
GET  /api/runs/:id/passport-update-transaction get signer-ready AgentPassport memory update tx
POST /api/runs/:id/passport-update     verify signed AgentPassportMemoryUpdated tx
```

CLI/dev-only today: explicit backend Sui CLI fallback for payment and receipt anchoring; the built-in Opportunity Scout delivery helper; `sui-dev` deterministic local smoke mode; and credentialed MemWal smoke unless MemWal env vars are configured. Live AgentPassport updates, stake, challenge, and slash routes produce signer-ready transaction requests and verify the signed Sui transaction through RPC events. x402 nonce and digest replay protection is persisted in `x402-replay-ledger.json` under the receipts directory. In production, an external worker agent should submit its own delivery and source evidence.

## Safety Rules

- Do not commit `.env`.
- Do not paste private keys or seed phrases.
- Use tiny SUI caps while testing.
- Upload evidence to Walrus before final Sui anchoring.
- Approve payment only after the UI shows the Sui work order id.
